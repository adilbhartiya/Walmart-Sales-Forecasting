# Walmart Sales Forecasting

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing predictive modeling techniques to forecast sales for multiple Walmart stores over a 12-week period. By analyzing historical sales data and incorporating various predictor variables such as holiday flags, consumer price index (CPI), and store-specific factors, the goal is to provide accurate predictions that can inform strategic business decisions and drive growth.

## Dataset Description

The project employs the `Wallmart Dataset.csv` dataset, containing historical sales data encompassing store ID, department ID, date, weekly sales, and other pertinent features. This dataset, representing weekly sales data from diverse Walmart outlets nationwide.

### Features

- **Store:** Store number.
- **Date:** Sales week.
- **Weekly_Sales:** Sales for the given store in that week.
- **Holiday_Flag:** Flag indicating if it is a holiday week.
- **Temperature:** Temperature on the day of the sale.
- **Fuel_Price:** Fuel cost in the region.
- **CPI:** Consumer Price Index.
- **Unemployment:** Unemployment Rate.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and understand the sales performance of a retail
store with multiple outlets across the country, which is currently facing challenges in
managing its inventory to match supply with demand.

The project aims to:
1. Conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of
the provided dataset, handle missing values, and identify any outliers.
2. Derive insights on how factors such as unemployment rate, seasonality, temperature,
and Consumer Price Index (CPI) affect weekly sales.
3. Identify the top and worst-performing stores based on historical data and quantify
the difference between them.
4. Use predictive modeling techniques to forecast the sales for each store for the next
12 weeks.

The ultimate goal is to provide the retail store with actionable insights and accurate sales
forecasts that can aid in effective inventory management and overall business decisionmaking.

## Key Features

- Predictive Modeling: Implementing machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost for sales forecasting.
- Evaluation Metrics: Comparing model performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to select the best-performing model.
- Strategic Insights: Providing valuable insights for business decision-making by identifying seasonal trends, analyzing the impact of predictor variables, and highlighting patterns in sales data.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand variable distributions and patterns.
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Engineered features such as lag variables, holiday flags, and store-specific features.

### Model Building

- Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
- Developed machine learning models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Tuned hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.

### Sales Forecasting

- Utilized the best-performing model to forecast sales for multiple Walmart stores over a 12-week period.
- Visualized forecasted sales data and compared with actual sales to assess model accuracy.

## Usage

1. Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess historical sales data, including feature engineering and handling missing values.
2. Model Development: Train machine learning models using various algorithms and evaluate their performance on validation data.
3. Sales Forecasting: Utilize the trained model to forecast sales for multiple Walmart stores over the next 12 weeks.
4. Decision Support: Analyze the forecasted sales data to gain strategic insights for inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.
